<a name="Introduction" /><h2>Introduction</h2>

For brevity the new code will be called DUnit2. 

In both DUnit and DUnit2, unit tests comprise classes derived from TTestCase, each containing 1 or more published test procedures as shown in the example below. TTestCase is now an interfaced object.

<blockquote><div class="default"><pre>
type
  TTestMyComms = class(TTestCase)
  published
    procedure VerifyThatThereIsAnUnAssignedCommPort;
    procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortOpens;
    procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortCloses;
  end;
</pre></div></blockquote>

Through the magic of RTTI or .NET Reflection DUnit is able to execute the published test procedures in an orderly fashion. Code written into test methods performs tests on user's code and calls one or more Check() procedures to signal pass or fail to the test framework.

<a name="SetUp_and_Teardown" /><h2>SetUp and Teardown</h2>
        
Both versions of DUnit implement SetUp and Teardown procedures. These execute at run-time before and after every test method respectively, providing an excellent means to pre-initialize testcase specific data, objects, connections etc and clean up the mess after each method. SetUp and Teardown execute regardless of exceptions within any test method.

Expanding the TTestCase class to include SetUp and Teardown procedures is simple as shown below.

<blockquote><div class="default"><pre>
type
TTestMyComms = class(TTestCase)
private
// your field variables here
protected
  procedure SetUp; override;
  procedure Teardown; override; // Close the Comm port here
published
  procedure VerifyThatThereIsAnUnAssignedCommPort;
  procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortOpens;
  procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortCloses;
end;
</pre></div></blockquote>
"SetUp" and "Teardown" optional procedures provide a convenient means to initialize variables, grab and release resources etc. However when multiple test methods are defined and the operation involves slow processes, like dialing modems, execution can slow unacceptably. Test times can be reduced significantly if the slow process is executed once and pre-established values maintained for the entire test duration. Test writers sometimes attempt to overcome the slowdown by putting the initializing code into the class constructor. In DUnit up to V9.4 this approach is flawed for the reasons shown below.
        
<a name="Constructors_and_Destructors" /><h2>Constructors and Destructors</h2>

In DUnit up to V9.4 each test procedure is implemented by creating individual instances of the defining TTestCase. As a consequence, the constructor runs for every defined test method. When the test suite is registered during initialization this activity occurs before the GUI opens. If the class utilizes a unique resource, global variable or grabs substantial amounts of memory then tests often fail inexplicably.
The classic problem of placing code in the constructor might look like the following.

<blockquote><div class="default"><pre>
type
TTestMyComms = class(TTestCase)
private
protected
  procedure SetUp; override;
  procedure Teardown; override;
published
  procedure VerifyThatThereIsAnUnAssignedCommPort;
  procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortOpens;
  procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortCloses;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Don't expect this to work properly in existing DUnit code &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
public
  constructor Create(const CommPortNo: integer);
  destructor Destroy; override;
end;
</pre></div></blockquote>

All constructor action takes place before the GUI fires up, so exceptions can force the application to close prematurely and sometimes fatally leak resources.
Similarly, unless all object references get set to nil in the TTestCase destructor exceptions will occur during program closure.<br>
There are still occasions when it would be really advantageous to be able to initialize say a database connection once and hold it for the entire duration of the test framework execution. There are "complex" ways to achieve the effect but the methodology is not standardized across unit testers.<

<a name="DUnit2_Constructors_and_Destructors" /><h2>DUnit2 Constructors and Destructors</h2>

DUnit2's design has been improved, so the TTestCase constructor and destructor only runs once for each registration of the class. Consequently, in DUnit2 allocating resources in a once off operation becomes standardized, more visible and safer to implement. Care is still required however because creation and destruction still occurs outside the GUI existence.

<a name="SetUpOnce_and_TeardownOnce" /><h2>SetUpOnce and TeardownOnce</h2>
        
DUnit2 introduces two new protected procedures "SetUpOnce" and "TeardownOnce". These significantly simplify the process of writing efficient unit tests and overcome the need to associate decorators and decorated tests. An added bonus is the absence of additional text and nodes in the GUI display. DUnit2 handles and reports exceptions in these procedures appropriately. Field variables are common to all procedures in the class, reducing code complexity and maintenance.

<blockquote><div class="default"><pre>
type
TTestMyComms = class(TTestCase)
private
// Shared variables go here
protected
  procedure SetUpOnce; override;
  procedure SetUp; override;
  procedure Teardown; override;
  procedure TeardownOnce; override;
published
  procedure VerifyThatThereIsAnUnAssignedCommPort;
  procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortOpens;
  procedure VerifyThatTheCommPortCloses;
end;
</pre></div></blockquote>

        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">
          <font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">Pattern aware DUnit author(s) provided a less convenient solution in V9.4 by introducing test "Decorators".<br>
          <br>
          To utilize a test decorator requires the coder to write a derivative class of TTestDecorator which also gets registered at initialization time. It contains just a SetUp and Teardown procedure. The following is an example.<br>
          <br></font></font></font></font>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="default">
              <pre>
type
TMyTestDecorator = class(TTestDecorator)
private
protected
  procedure SetUp; override;
  procedure Teardown; override;
end;
</pre>
            </div>
          </blockquote><font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">In the initialization section I think the registration is supposed to look something like the following.<br>
          <br></font></font></font></font>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="default">
              <pre>
initialization
  RegisterTest(TMyTestDecorator.Suite('Optional Name', TMyDecoratedTests.Suite));
end.
</pre>
            </div>
          </blockquote><font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">When the test suite is executed TMyTestDecorator's SetUp procedure executes once before any code in TMyDecoratedTests.<br>
          Similarly TMyTestDecorator's Teardown procedure executes after the last Teardown in TMyDecoratoratedTests<br>
          <br>
          The simplicity of use eludes many, perhaps because there were few clear examples in the earlier DUnit documentation. The test decorator class solves the problem of having to set up and tear down code whenever the process only needs to be done once for a particular test case instance.<br>
          <br>
          For test writers the main problem is that field variables in the decorator are not easily shared with the decorated tests class. When multiple decorators are required there is no natural association to help keep track of which decorator class goes with which test case class.<br>
          <br>
          Implementation of tests decorators in DUnit2 is straight forward. Decorator classes can continue to inherit from TTestSetup to gain access to GetName read or change the new DisplayedName property. Both classes register in the same manner as V9.4 DUnit2 test decorators can be nested to any depth but the issue of sharing variables still exist.<br>
          Decorators can now register multiple test cases simultaneously thus:-<br></font></font></font></font>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="default">
              <pre>
initialization
  RegisterTest(TMyTestDecorator.Suite('SuiteName' , TMyDecoratedTests.Suite,
TMoreDecoratedTests.Suite]));
end.
</pre>
            </div>
          </blockquote><font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="4">This improves the versatility because each contained TTestCase can use their own SetUp and TearDown procedures as required. In addition decorators can be nested in varoius ways:-<br></font></font></font></font></font>
          <blockquote>
            <div class="default">
              <pre>

Some tests however may generate memory leaks by virtue of calling leaky code outside the coder's control. Sometimes such soft test failures might not be considered failures of the tested code. Memory leaks of known size can also be programmed to pass while allowing leaks of any other size to raise a failure.<br>
            <br>
            Similarly, some tests might not be programmed to call Check() because the tested code only needs to execute without raising an exception to be considered a pass. Boolean properties can be set during the test method execution to suppress post test failures, overriding the GUI's global command.<br>
            "Overrides" was the count of tests set to suppress display of post execution failures.<br>
            <br>
            Note that potential post execution failures are not detectable or even show in V9.4 if they aren't armed to fail. Consequently testers may not be alerted to latent code problems.</font></font></font></font></font></font>

            To discover which tests contain these statements the user runs the tests with just the yellow button selected.<br>
            Yellow - indicates which tests contain statements overriding the GUI, that have not failed.<br>
            <br>
            As mentioned above, in both V9.4 and DUnit2 the tester can choose to override the GUI global commands so specific test methods don't fail on soft failures. DUnit2 adds yellow and orange node colours to identify tests where run-time properties have overridden the GUI.<br>
            Yellow - indicates which tests contain statements overriding the GUI, that have not failed.<br>
            Orange - indicates which overridden tests would have failed.<br>

            "Warnings" will however still have a count of the potential failures.<br>

            There are times where test suite execution times would benefit from executing the summary level test first and if it passes then skip the detailed level checks.<br>
            Conversely, if the summary level test failed then all the summary level checks should run. If they all pass only the initial failure would be reported.<br>

            <font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="4"><font size="+1">During the process of analyzing the original DUnit's inner workings to add leak detection one aspect of the execution flow became obvious. TTestResult was repeatedly visiting then being visited by the execution flow in a very hard to follow manner (well for me, not necessarily for the initial writers). One consequence was that memory leak detection code had to execute multiple times for each test method.<br>
            <br>
            Another point of code inefficiency involves reporting status back to the GUI after every test. The existing DUnit code unnecessarily refreshes the TestTree right back up to the highest node for every test regardless of whether there will be any status change. DUnit2 only ripples necessary changes back to the higher levels.<br>
            <br>
            Normal displayed unit testing times show very little difference between the new and old code. However there is a significant speed increase when conducting repeat tests. 10000 loops calling Check(True) from a RepeatTest decorator in older DUnit takes 145 secs compared with only 38 secs in new DUnit2. Efforts to improve code efficiency are paying dividends, albeit in an infrequently used aspect.<br>
            One unexpected speed improvement occurs when executing TextTestRunner on a complex project's suite of tests (1200+) such as tiOPF2. The new tests begin execution approximately 4 seconds earlier.<br>
            <br>
            Prior to test suite execution DUnit2 builds a linear list of ITest references in each TestProject for rapid access at runtime. The list is is now scanned sequentially rather than code reccursing into a tree structure. Calls back to the TestTree to check each node for enabled status have been replaced but other Listeners are still polled.</font></font></font></font></font></font>

            <font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="4"><font size="+1">For simple projects the main .dpr just needs to name GUITestRunner or TextTestRunner as before. The project paths should be pointed to the new code src folder or DCU set. Similarly, most unit tests still only need to refer to TestFramework.<br>
            <br>
            TTestResult class definition had been hidden from external access and a function GetTestResult now returns an interfaced object version instead. So, for those specialist test suite writers who directly access TestResult data need to call that function to get a reference. The variable is now an interface type which should to be set to nil instead of calling .Free. Nothing major.<br>
            Similarly, TTestFailure has been upgraded to being an interface and no longer requires a call to .Free to clean up each instance.<br>
            <br>
            Existing unit tests are still register as before. e.g. :-<br>
<blockquote>
  <div class="default">
    <pre>
Registertest(TMyTestCase.Suite);
Registertests('MyNamedGroupOfTests', [TTestCaseABC.Suite, TTestCaseXYZ.Suite]); 
    </pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>            
            
Registering multiple test in the same named TestSuite will display the tests together in the TestTree view and their execution will be sequential.<br>
            <br>
            Legacy Unit Test Suites.<br>
            Some "legacy" unit tests with complex test scenarios have not been converted to using interfaces yet and may so not compile because the required TTestCase methods are not public. As an aid, All Check() and Fail() methods have been made public. In addition TAbstractTest definition has been re-added to the code and represents an ITestProc. A parameterless RunTest method has been added.<br>

            <font size="+1"><font size="5"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="4"><font size="+1">Unit test writers who create instances of TTestCase on the fly (now an interfaced object) need to change variable definitions from TTestCase to ITestCase. Naturally one should not call .Free when their useful life has passed. Either set the reference to nil or let them die by Delphi magic.<br>
            Perhaps more noticeable is that the constructor for TTestCase instances no longer needs a string parameter. In all the unit tests I have encountered these have all been empty i.e.<br>
<blockquote>
  <div class="default">
    <pre>
FMyTestCase := TMyTestCase.Create('');
// &lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;
FMyTestCase := TMyTestCase.Create;

            Note. DUnit2 now allows creating TTestCases with an empty string. TTestCase can be inherited from and additional characteristics added. New classes also need to override the appropriate constructor(s) to ensure proper registration. Adding once off setup operations in these constructors is now possible although it has disadvantages compared with using SetUpOnce.<br>
            <br>
            TTestCase instances created on-the-fly should be allocated to a local or field variable and should not be registered. Code can be executed by calling LMyTests.Run(AnIExecControl) where AnIExecControl is a local instance of an ITestExecControl. For the following code to compile an additional unit "TestFrameworkIfaces" may need to be added to your unit test's uses clause.<br>
<blockquote>
  <div class="default">
    <pre>
interface
uses
TestFrameworkIfaces,
TestFramework;

......

implementation

procedure TMyTestCaseRunner.VerifyMyEmbeddedTestCasePasses;
var LMyTestCase: ITestCase; // Might need to be TMyTestCase in .NET
LExecControl: ITestExecControl;
begin
  LExecControl := TestExecControl;

// Get ref to new instance of a TTestExecControl
  LMyTestCase := TMyTestCase.Create;&lt;
  Check(LMyTestCase.Run(LExecControl) = _Passed, 'Oh damn, it failed');

// No need to destroy the local vars, they are interfaces and Delphi does it for you

            <br>
            Crafted unit tests can now be executed by calling RunTest instead of defining a test method.<br>
            The first step is to define a new type inherited from ITestProc or for Legacy code TAbstractTest.<br>
            In the class definition override RunTest and place the test code and Check() or Fail() therein.<br>
            The constructor can accept a string which does not have to conform with Delphi method names.<br>
            Note, there can only be one RunTest method defined per class.<br>
            RunTest does not take TTestResult as a parameter and is not called from TTestResult.<br>
            At run time create an inherited empty instance of TTestCase and add one or more of the above TTestProcs.<br>

The root node is assigned the project executable name and tests follow in order of registration. Tests registered in named Test Suites however are grouped together, regardless of registration order as in V9.4.<br>
            To segregate tests for execution in separate threads (future work) a new inherited type "ITestProject" has been introduced.<br>
            <br>
            When more than one project is registered test cases not specifically register to a named project are relegated to a project called "Default Project". The TestTree becomes:-<br>
            <br>
            ProjectName.exe - Default Project<br>
            some test cases<br>
            FirstNamed Project<br>
            some more test cases<br>
            SecondNamedNamed Project etc.<br>
            even more test cases<br>
            <br>
            A suite of tests can be compiled into a DLL and registered using unit "TestModules.pas" procedures.<br>
            DLL based tests show in the TestTree as a project using the DLL name. At some time in the future someone more familiar with .NET might like to so the same for Assemblies. Registration is shown below.</font></font></font></font></font></font>

            The syntax for registering tests in named a project is simple. In unit test unit's initialization section the registration code looks like the following.

            When JEDI_JCL is armed to perform stack tracing the generated strings acquire memory which the memory leak detection code flags as a soft failure. Provision has been made in code to allow StackTracing to be disarmed when memory leak detection is enabled.</font></font></font></font></font></font>
