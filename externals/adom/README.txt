What is the Alternative Document Object Model Package?
------------------------------------------------------

The 'Alternative Document Object Model' Package for Delphi and 
Kylix contains several functions, classes, and components which 
support the processing of XML documents. It allows to represent 
an XML document by Delphi objects which reproduce the structure 
and content of the XML document in an object tree. XML parser 
components contained in the package make it easy to transform 
any XML file or XML string into such an object tree, which then 
can be modified or evaluated by a great number of available 
functions. A detailed documentation is included. 


Website
-------

The project's home is located at the Open XML website: 
"http://www.philo.de/xml/".

Delphi 5, 6, 7, 8, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, XE 1 and
